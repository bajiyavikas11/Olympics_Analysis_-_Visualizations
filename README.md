# Olympic Track & Field Analytics Project

## Overview

This project focuses on exploring and visualizing Olympic Track & Field performance data to uncover insights into athlete performance trends over time. The analyses are inspired by Kaggle submissions and New York Times (NYT)-style visuals, aiming to match or exceed their quality.

## Objectives

1. Analyze the Olympic Track & Field dataset to identify performance trends and patterns.
2. Create high-quality visuals to highlight key insights, including:
   - Scatterplots for individual events.
   - NYT-style comparative visualizations.
3. Develop interactive dashboards for in-depth exploration by event and gender.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Enhanced Olympic Track & Field Results Dataset
- **File**: `OlympicTrackAndFieldResultsEnhanced.csv`
- **Key Variables**:
  - Event name, Year, Athlete, Country, Medal, Performance metrics (e.g., seconds, meters).

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Scatterplot for a Single Event
- Visualized performance improvements over time for a selected event.
- Annotations added to highlight key milestones and trends.

### 2. NYT-style Visualization
- Compared Olympic medalists' performances against Usain Bolt's 2012 100m sprint.
- Included contextual notes, such as performance gaps across decades.

### 3. Interactive Dashboards
- **Scatterplot Dashboard**: Allows filtering by event and gender.
- **NYT-style Dashboard**: Enables comparisons for selected events and genders.

### 4. Event Exploration
- Deep-dive analysis into two notable events using dashboards.
- Insights include performance trends, medal distributions, and standout athletes.

### 5. Additional Storytelling Visuals
- Bar charts highlighting the most decorated athletes and countries in Olympic history.
- Line charts showing individual athlete performance trends.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Data Processing**: Python (Pandas, NumPy).
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Tableau.

## Key Insights

1. **Performance Improvements**: Consistent downward trends in race times, reflecting advancements in training, technology, and competition.
2. **Country Dominance**: The USA and Great Britain lead in medal counts, showcasing strong athletic programs.
3. **Event Trends**: Significant performance improvements in events like the pole vault and 200m race.
4. **Athlete Analysis**: Individual trends highlight career peaks and declines, such as Merlene Ottey's 200m performance.
